# Peer Grading Guide

Weekly group assignments will be peer graded. This means that each student will be responsible for
grading one group's assignment submission.

Your group's grade will be the average of the grades submitted by your peers.

### Which group's assignment will I grade?

Each week your instructor will assign you a project to grade.

### How is my group's grade determined?

Your project grade will be the average score given by the students who grade your project. Typically 3-5 students will grade
each project. Assuming you have 4 graders and receive scores of 90, 90, 90, and 100, your final grade would be a 92.5.

### What if I'm unhappy with my grade?

If you feel that your grade is incorrect, you can appeal your grade. To appeal your grade, you must submit a request to the
instructor and Program Manager via email within 24 hours of receiving your grade. Your appeal must include a written
explanation of why you deserve a higher grade. Appeals received more than 24 hours after you receive your grade and appeals
without a clear explanation will not be answered.

Examples of a valid appeal justification:

> The graders commented that our login feature did not work properly, however all aspects of our login work and all tests pass.
> I suspect this may be browser specific issue. In development, we used the latest version of Firefox.

> I believe our graders misunderstood requirement #3. They deducted points because we used an abstract class rather than an
> interface. The requirements did not specify which to use and I believe an abstract class is better choice because all sub-classes
> share a common implementation of the add method.

Examples of an invalid appeal justification:

> My teammate didn't do his job and it's not fair for me to be punished for that.

> I've been working really hard and these expectations are ridiculous.

> Your instructions were unclear.

Please note that only one group member needs to appeal the group's grade. You fail and succeed as a team. If one team member's
grade is raised the entire team's grade will be raised.

### How do I grade an assignment?

To grade an assignment, use the rubric below. Note that the only valid grades that you may assign are 100, 90, 80, 70, 50,
or 0.

#### 100:

A project receives 100 if it meets all requirements and it demonstrates one or more of the following:

- fully functional features beyond the scope of the project that add value to the application
- exceptional understanding of a concept not covered in class (e.g. advanced data structures, advanced SQL queries, or
  secure coding practices)

#### 90:

A project receives 90 if it meets all requirements

#### 80:

A project receives 80 if it meets most requirements but has a few small bugs (e.g. there is good test coverage but
a test case was missed or you can add new Users to the database but there is not good error messaging
when you send an invalid userName)

#### 70:

A project receives 70 if it completely fails to meet one requirement entirely or if the requirements are generally met but the program has a
fairly significant bug (e.g. Users cannot be added to the database unless the provide their own id when in reality the database
should create the id for them or the login feature works but it checks only for username OR password match rather than username
AND password match)

#### 50:

A project receives 50 if it meets only some requirements (missing more than 1 entirely or several partially) or if it does not have adequate test coverage
(**Please note that a full functionality project with inadequate test coverage receives a maximum grade of 50**)

#### 0:

A project receives 0 if it meets less than 50% of the requirements.

### What do I need to submit for my peer review?

You must submit a numerical grade using the provided rubric and a written explaination (1-5 sentences) explaining why you
assigned that grade.

### When is the peer review due?

Peer review is due by the start of class 4 days (actual days not class days) after assignment submission. Should this day
fall on a weekend, reviews are due the following Monday.

For example, if your class meets Monday through Friday

- Assigments are due Friday morning, reviews are due Tuesday morning.
- Assigments are due Thursday morning, reviews are due Monday morning.
- Assigments are due Wednesday morning, reviews are due Monday morning.
- Assigments are due Tuesday morning, reviews are due Monday morning.
- Assigments are due Monday morning, reviews are due Friday morning.

### What if my peer review is late?

- You will receive a 50% reduction in your project grade if your review is turned in late unless you have a documented
  emergency.
